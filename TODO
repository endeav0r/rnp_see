Elf64 :: patch_relocations ()
    Needs to deal with the following relocations which are currently ignored
        R_X86_64_TPOFF64
        R_X86_64_DTPMOD64
        R_X86_64_IRELATIVE

Translator :: operand_get ()
    When we have an instruction with a memory load and a segmentation offset, we
    don't perform a load. So far, the only segmentation instruction I have found
    are those used in libc inside the macro PTR_MANGLE().
