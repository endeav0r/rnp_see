Elf64 :: patch_relocations ()
    Needs to deal with the following relocations which are currently ignored
        R_X86_64_TPOFF64
        R_X86_64_DTPMOD64
        R_X86_64_IRELATIVE

Translator :: translate ()
    movqa is an ALIGNED movq. Need a way to deal with this at runtime. Currently
    movqa instructions just calls movq.
    movdqa just calls movdqu.

Translator :: scasb ()
    Is supposed to compare against ES:RDI, but currently just uses RDI

udis86 incorrectly detects movdqa instruction as movqa. submit bug report.

Translator :: *
	All instructions need to use operand_set (). operand_set() will insure the
	lhs of the assignment is the full size of the destination register. IE
	add eax, ecx;
	Needs to extend the value of (eax + ecx) to 64-bits in the VM. The VM doesn't
	know the semantics of its variables, so the Translator must tell the VM to
	store the result in 64-bit register. operand_set() does this.
